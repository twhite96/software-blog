I have also given up on IT/DevOps as a career. I will be talking about this more in another post somewhere else which I'll link to, but it is what it is for me.<p>This means I have more time to build software when I get a chance and for fun and for my next endeavour which means this blog is my main one for software dev for the foreseeable future.<p>I am glad to consolidate things and pare things down to just this blog and my next endeavour <a href=https://tifflabs.org rel=noopener target=_blank>Tiff Labs</a>.<h2 id=what-is-tiff-labs>What is Tiff Labs?</h2><p>First, I've quit trying to have a career in tech proper. It's just not going to happen for someone my age during a recession like this. I don't have a degree and am fully self-taught. This is a big strike against me returning to the workforce in tech and if I can't do that, I will do my own thing. I have income from other sources to be able to do this so I am not too concerned about making ends meet for now.<p>Tiff Labs is an umbrella of things- a YouTube channel, a blog, a smart home resource, and a homelab resource. I can make money from that once I get more content up and posted<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#1>1</a></sup>.<p>I will also be doing more DIY repairing of devices and DIY building of things in general. I enjoy working with my hands more than working with code. I love both, don't get me wrong. However working with my hands gives me immense joy I don't find while writing software.<h2 id=what-this-blog-will-be>What this blog will be</h2><p>It will be a place for me to talk about the software I build for my other projects and hopefully a small business at some point. That's it.<p>Here is a project I'd like to build in Go:<blockquote class=reddit-embed-bq data-embed-height=364><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1e6cwgi/comment/lds2v63/>Comment</a><br> by<a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/TheBrownViking20/>u/TheBrownViking20</a> from discussion<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1e6cwgi/what_is_the_most_interesting_golang_cli_app_youve/></a><br> in<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/>golang</a></blockquote><script async charset=UTF-8 src=https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js></script><div class=footnote-definition id=1><sup class=footnote-definition-label>1</sup><p>I know that affiliate links are frowned upon but other than ads which I don't want to run, this will have to do for now.</div><p class=tags-data></main><footer><hr><div id=footer-container><div>Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ target=_blank>Creative Commons Attribution .0 International</a> license.</div><div><p>Theme and color theme licensed under <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licence_MIT target=_blank>MIT</a>.<br> Built with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://www.getzola.org target=_blank>Zola</a> using <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://github.com/Speyll/anemone target=_blank>anemone</a> theme, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://speyll.github.io/suCSS/ target=_blank>suCSS</a> framework & <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://github.com/Speyll/veqev target=_blank>veqev</a>.<br></div><div><a rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Subscribe via RSS for updates." class=no-style href=https://tiff.engineer/atom.xml target=_blank><svg class=icons><use href=https://tiff.engineer/icons.svg#rss></use></svg></a></div></div></footer>

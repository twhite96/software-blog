        <content type="html" xml:base="https://example.com/blog/hello-yall/">&lt;p&gt;This is a learning and accountability blog. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first post. It will be updated as time permits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things frustrating me lately is when I was just starting out, I blogged about literally everything; the industry was new to me and everyone was excited, I was excited at the possibility of pulling myself out of extreme poverty. I was younger, bright-eyed, without any cynicism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 10 years and a lot has changed. I won&#x27;t get into the gory details but y&#x27;all know. Tech is not what it used to be, I&#x27;ve grown to despise most JavaScript anything, and I&#x27;m an industry vet who is disillusioned by the state of the industry and the world in general. That kind of pessimism weighs on me daily, so much so I don&#x27;t write about anything I learn. It sucks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is my blog post I&#x27;m sending you, I hope you read it. (Bonus points is you get that reference).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
